# RESTful API: Events, Venues and Artists

## Abstract

- This project is a RESTful API for data regarding events, venues and artists.

## Requirements

- Java 8 (JDK 8)
- maven

## How to build and run

1. To compile just do ```mvn clean package```
2. To run the application execute the following ```java -jar target/reactive-rest-service*.jar```

or alternatively run with maven:

1. ```mvn clean install```
2. ```mvn spring-boot:run``` 


Application should start at ```http://localhost:8080```.

## Exploring the API

The application contains the following REST endpoints:
```
GET /artist/{artist-id} - Get artist information for a specific artistId. eg. /artist/23

GET /venue/{venue-id} - Get venue information for a specific venueId. eg /venue/43
```

The ```Swagger``` can be used to test/explore the endpoints: ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/```

## External dependencies

Data regarding events, venues and artists is retrieved from the following endpoints:

```
https://iccp-interview-data.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/78656681/events.json -> contains data for events. It links to artists and venues via ids
https://iccp-interview-data.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/78656681/artists.json -> contains data for artists.
https://iccp-interview-data.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/78656681/venues.json -> contains data for venues
```

## Possible Improvements

- Authentication on endpoints for security
- Containerization
- Cacheing on queries to events, venues and artists external endpoints for faster response

## Other info
Actuator has been added to the project to expose operational information about the running application â€” health, metrics, info, etc.
